# Tracker music  
## What is a tracker?  
It is a kind of software to make music. Modules are the music files, which looks like Excel/Calc spreadsheets.  
As an analogy:  
* The file or module contains pages.  
* Pages are patterns which are played consecutively.  
* Rows in pages contains instruments, notes, effects and volumes.  
* Rows are played one by one, consecutively. 0, then 1, then 2, then 3...  
* Patterns can be reused, or jump from one to another.
